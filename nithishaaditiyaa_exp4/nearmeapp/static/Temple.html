        <hr>
        Several Shiva temples have a Jeeva Samadhi, which is the tomb of a saint or Siddhar who is believed to have attained spiritual liberation while still in a physical body. Examples include the Jeeva Samadhi of Mahan Gangadhara Navalar within his temple in Chennai, which includes a Shiva Lingam, and the Jeeva Samadhi of Bogar Siddhar within the Murugan Temple in Palani. Many of these temples have a central Shiva sanctum along with the Samadhi, sometimes marked by a Shiva Lingam or a Rishabam (bull) statue.
